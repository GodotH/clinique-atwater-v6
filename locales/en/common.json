    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Why am I still in pain?",
        "answer": "Pain is your body's warning that something isn't working properly.\n\nHere's what actually happens when you get hurt: Your body doesn't completely heal injuries—it patches them with scar tissue, then creates workarounds to keep you moving pain-free. This masks the real problem.\n\nWhen you first get injured, your body is remarkably good at compensating. It alters your movement patterns and recruits different muscles to take over for the damaged ones. This keeps you pain-free initially, but the original problem remains—it's just hidden.\n\nThe problem with compensation: Your body can only maintain these workarounds for so long. Eventually, it exhausts its ability to compensate. When these backup systems fail, chronic pain emerges—sometimes in a completely different location from the original injury.\n\nWhy finding the real cause is so difficult: That back pain you're feeling? It could actually stem from an old ankle injury that altered your walking pattern, which disrupted your pelvic motion, which then affected your spine. This chain reaction typically develops over months or even years.\n\nYour situation may be more complex if:\n• You've tried multiple treatments without success → This often means the source is deeply hidden.\n• You've been in pain for a long time → This suggests it has created compensatory secondary problems.\n• You have old injuries or compensation patterns that went untreated → Each one accumulates local damage.\n• You experience pain in multiple areas of your body → This often indicates an underlying metabolic condition (like inflammation or immune problems).\n\nHow we approach your pain:\nWe view your entire body as an interconnected system. We trace back to identify where things first went wrong, then address as many of the main hidden causes at the source of your pain."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many sessions do I need?",
        "answer": "Recovery time varies based on your unique situation. Some patients experience noticeable relief after their first visit, while others need more time to address the underlying issues slowing their healing and recovery.\n\nFactors that influence your healing timeline:\n• Cause – How easy or difficult it is to find and target the main cause among the many hidden problems causing your pain?\n• Severity and complexity – Simple vs. complex conditions – whether issues are composed of multiple layers.\n• Duration – How recent your problem occurred (acute) versus chronic issues lasting months/years (which take longer to reverse).\n• Health history – Past injuries, traumas, and lifestyle factors.\n• Your body's healing capacity – Age, fitness level, overall health, and metabolic state.\n• Lifestyle factors – Your nutrition, activity level, sleep quality, stress management, and physical demands on your body.\n\nTypical Treatment Timelines:\n• Recent acute pain (days to weeks): 3–6 sessions\nExamples: Simple neck strain, new back pain\n\n• Moderate problems (1–6 months): 8–12 sessions\nExamples: Recurring headaches, ongoing back stiffness\n\n• Chronic conditions (6+ months): 15–25+ sessions\nExamples: Long-term neck/back pain, complex spine issues"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Chiropractic?",
        "answer": "Chiropractic is a type of healthcare focused on your spine and nervous system, which controls everything in your body. When spinal joints get stuck or misaligned, they interfere with nerve communication, causing pain and health problems.\n\nChiropractors restore proper movement and alignment with a chiropractic adjustment—a precise, controlled hand (or instrument) movement applied to specific joints that have become restricted in their movement. This helps restore proper joint motion and position, enhancing your body's natural ability to heal itself, without drugs or surgery.\n\nModern chiropractic care extends far beyond adjustments. It can include:\n• Spinal & Joint Adjustments – Core intervention supported by evidence for low back pain, neck pain, and headaches\n• Soft tissue therapies – massage, trigger point therapy, and myofascial release\n• Therapeutic exercises – rehabilitation and strengthening programs\n• Lifestyle counseling – posture, ergonomics, nutrition, and stress management\n• Applied Kinesiology testing – using muscle testing and pain indicator testing\n• Collaborative care – with other healthcare professionals when appropriate"
      },
      {
        "question": "What Training Does a Chiropractor Have?",
        "answer": "Doctors of Chiropractic (DC) earn their degrees after extensive education and training, which makes them experts in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neuromusculoskeletal conditions.\n\nIn Quebec, chiropractors complete a 5-year doctoral program (245 university credits) at an accredited institution, similar to medical doctors (who complete 225 university credits).\n\nThe 4,969+ hours of coursework covers:\n• Fundamental sciences: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology\n• Clinical sciences: diagnosis, radiology, orthopedics, neurology\n• Chiropractic sciences: spinal biomechanics, adjustment techniques, treatment protocols\n• Complementary disciplines: nutrition, exercise therapy, rehabilitation\n• Real patient experience from year one: students begin observing and assisting with patient care\n• 18-month supervised clinical internship: the final stage involves providing treating to hundreds of patients under direct supervision of experienced chiropractors"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is chiropractic care safe?",
        "answer": "Chiropractic care is one of the safest healthcare treatments available, with serious complications occurring in fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 treatments. Among the 9,000+ licensed practitioners across Canada, all with doctoral-level training and strict regulatory oversight, an estimated 30 million chiropractic treatments are delivered each year to 4.7 million Canadians — with an exceptional safety record.\n\nThe most common effects are mild and temporary:\n• Slight soreness for 24–48 hours — similar to post-workout muscle fatigue\n• Brief stiffness as your body adjusts to improved movement\n• Temporary tiredness as your nervous system recalibrates\n\nRisk of serious complications by treatment type:\n• All surgeries: 1 in 8 patients experience complications\n• NSAIDs (Advil, Tylenol, etc.): 1 in every 300 users is hospitalized annually\n• Chiropractic adjustments: Fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 cases"
      },
      {
        "question": "How effective is chiropractic care in Canada?",
        "answer": "Chiropractic care is safe, effective and widely used in Canada. Each year, nearly 5 million Canadians (about 1 in 7) see a chiropractor with 90% patient satisfaction rate—adding up to over 30 million chiropractic sessions annually across the country.\n\nChiropractic helps patients recover faster, avoid unnecessary medications or surgeries, and live pain-free—with millions of success stories every year.\n\n• Faster Recovery\n56% of chronic low-back pain patients improved after just one month of chiropractic care—vs. only 13% under family doctors alone.\n\n• Better Work Outcomes\nInjured workers who saw chiropractors returned to work 51% faster than those treated by medical doctors.\n\n• Quality of Life\nNearly 70% of patients in integrated healthcare programs experienced meaningful improvements in pain, function, and well-being.\n\n• Satisfaction\nOver 93% of patients were satisfied with chiropractic care in collaborative clinical settings."

      {
        "question": "What is Applied Kinesiology?",
